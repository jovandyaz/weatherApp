/*
YOUR VIEW - RENDERER


Here's what should go inside of your Renderer class:

A method renderData which appends data to the HTML
This mentod should take allCityData - an array of all the city data and use Handlebars and jQuery to render it on the HTML


Though it's not explicitly part of your render class, you also need to add in your Handlebars template to your HTML. The template should include:

A div for each city
The city name
The temperature
The conditions
The time last updated
An image of the conditions
Any other data you want
